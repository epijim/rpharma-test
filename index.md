## About

R/Pharma is an ISC working group (www.r-consortium.org/projects/isc-working-groups) under the R Consortium. This working group aims to provide a yearly collegial and vendor neutral conference focused on the use of R in the development of pharmaceuticals. The conference covers topics including reproducible research, regulatory compliance and validation, safety monitoring, clinical trials, drug discovery, research & development, PK/PD/pharmacometrics, genomics, diagnostics, immunogenicity and more. 

All is discussed within the context of using R as a primary tool within the drug development process. The conference showcases the current use of R that is helping to drive biomedical research, drug discovery & development, and clinical initiatives. (Note that topics related to the use of R in hospitals/clinics for patient care by clinicians, doctors, and researchers are the focus of the groups sister conference, R/Medicine.)
